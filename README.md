# IpCamReader
## What is it ?
A small python3 script to allow IP cam users to get the video from an ipcam in a small window

## How can I run it ?
1. You need to download an IPCam software (I use them on phone for example).

2. Get its IP (make sure your network allows communication between the 2 machines)

3. Download cam.py

4. Run it in your terminal, you must give the IP as an argument (example ```$py cam.py 192.168.xxx.yyy:zzz``` where z is the port of the cam)

## The camera is flipped upside down, what can I do ?

You can use the keys 'a','z','e','r' to rotate the camera flux

## Are you gonna update it ?
Yup next step is trying to handle command only accesible via UI on the webapp, also changing the keys to rotate the cam to something else (AZER is convenient for only a small population after all)
